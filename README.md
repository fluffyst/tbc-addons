### DPSMateTBC
A combat analyzation tool

DPSMate is not only a meter which shows numbers of the raid, such as damage done, damage taken, dispells etc., it is moreover an analyzing tool to review the raid or the previous fight as accurately as possible. This data can help to improve the gameplay or to judge better over someones performance.

### ElvUI-TBC
Backported version of ElvUI for World of Warcraft - The Burning Crusade (2.4.3)

ElvUI is a full UI replacement. It completely replaces the default Blizzard UI at every level with a new and better interface. As such, you'll only ever have to update ElvUI and not worry too much about its individual components. This UI will arrange your interface to be more flexible and practical.

### NWTooltipFix

**For use on Atlantiss, Netherwing. Remember to remove this addon on patch 2.3!**

NWTooltipFix will fix the tooltips of a few items and spells to reflect the 2.0 state they are in. It's needed because in some rare cases the 2.4.3 client can not display the correct tooltips for 2.0 items/spells.

The following will be fixed:

* Healing gear granting spell damage
* Leatherworking drums stating they can be used while shapeshifted (also added in cast time display)
* Debuff tooltip for Vashj's Persuasion
* Crafting yield of Fisherman's Feast (as of version 1.1)

### Omen
**Modified for Atlantiss Netherwing/Karazhan**

Provide accurate values of your group's relative threat level on individual enemies, so that you can see when you're in danger of pulling aggro (or, if you're next on the snack list if your tank bites it). This info is usually only critical in raids, where only tanks can survive aggro, but it's useful for any multi-player situation.
