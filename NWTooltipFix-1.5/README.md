## What does it do

NWTooltipFix will fix the tooltips of a few items and spells to reflect the 2.0 state they are in. It's needed because in some rare cases the 2.4.3 client can not display the correct tooltips for 2.0 items/spells. 

The following will be fixed:

* Healing gear granting spell damage
* Leatherworking drums stating they can be used while shapeshifted (also added in cast time display)
* Debuff tooltip for Vashj's Persuasion
* Crafting yield of Fisherman's Feast (as of version 1.1)


## How to install

Go to Releases in https://github.com/nullfoxh/NWTooltipFix/releases and download NWTooltipFix.zip. Extract it to your World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns folder and you're done!

## Latest Changes - Version 1.5

* Fixed display of Scalding Water's damage over time
